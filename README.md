## Description

Guitar Bro works completely in browser and is based on [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). Currently Guitar Bro works only in Chrome, since only Chrome allows to change the [resolution of FFT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/fftSize) to distinguish different notes on guitar.
